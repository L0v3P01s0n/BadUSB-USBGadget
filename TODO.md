# TODO

1) More keyboard layouts.
2) Modify usbarsenal to directly change attackmode.
3) Find a way to tamper with the PinePhone's LEDs, just like the Bash Bunny, and add functions to control them.
4) Add a Bash Bunny script converter, as they are incompatible with each other.
5) Maybe try to add geofencing and remote triggers... when all of the above is done.
