# TODO

· Adding automation to it with another script
· Moaaar keyboard layouts
· Try to make a function that lets you choose the layout before executing the payload on the automation script
· Find a way to tamper with the PinePhone's LEDs, just like the Bash Bunny, and add functions to control them
· Figure out mass storage mode XD
· Maybe try to add geofencing... when all of the above is done
