# TODO

1) Adding automation to it with another script
2) Moaaar keyboard layouts
3) Try to make a function that lets you choose the layout before executing the payload on the automation script
4) Find a way to tamper with the PinePhone's LEDs, just like the Bash Bunny, and add functions to control them
5) Figure out mass storage mode XD
6) Maybe try to add geofencing... when all of the above is done
